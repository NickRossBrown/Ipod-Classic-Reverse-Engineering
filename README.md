### What is the point of this repo?

Learning. It was really dope of Tanner to make his repo open source. <b>The git in this repo was reinitialized around the 2nd/3rd commit.</b>

This repo is a saving point to help figure out how Tanner built and styled the ipod. I plan on gaining an understanding about the repo by seperating how the components and styles into different files/folders/modules and play around with the props.
